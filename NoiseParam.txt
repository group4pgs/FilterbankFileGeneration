##Define Broadband Noise below. 
# Set Occurrences to 1 if you want to start.
# Magnitude: The magnitude of the noise i.t.o. the number of standard deviations from the expected value (0< value ≤ 6).
# t_startand t_end: The start time and end time of the RFI instances ( s )
Broadband Occurrences 1
Broadband t_start 0.01
Broadband t_end 0.02
Broadband Magnitude 5

# Define Narrowband Noise below
# Set Occurrences to 1 if you want to start.
# Magnitude: The magnitude of the noise i.t.o. the number of standard deviations from the expected value (0< value ≤ 6).
# t_startand t_end: The start time and end time of the RFI instances ( s )
# F_start and F_end: Start and End Frequency ( MHz ) **Make sure that the --fch1 & --nchans & --foff (Channel BW) would be sufficient**

# Same as mentioned above just include some Period Parameters
# Period of the periodic noise (s)
# Specify how long the RFI should be 'on' as a percentage of its period (0<value<99)
